# LASTPROOF — Work Log

Perpetual, append-only session log. **Newest entry at the top.** Every Claude
session touching this repo reads the top of this file before work, and writes a
new entry at the top when a work block ships. See `CLAUDE.md § Session protocol`
for the rules.

This log is one of a pair:

- `WORKLOG.md` (this file) — LASTPROOF repo, covers LASTPROOF work
- `lastshiftcoin/lastshift-terminal` → `WORKLOG.md` — Terminal repo, covers Terminal work

When a change in one repo impacts the other (shared contract, shared secret,
API signature, wallet/TID handshake), note it on the `**Impacts:**` line of
your entry. The other platform's next session will see the pointer and read
the linked entry before touching related code.

When this file exceeds ~500 lines, roll the oldest half into
`WORKLOG-ARCHIVE.md` and keep only the recent entries here.

## 2026-04-20 22:39 MST — Multi-session onboarding + protocol codification

**Device:** Tallada's MacBook Air (`Talladas-MacBook-Air.local`, macOS 26.4.1 arm64)
**Platform:** Claude Desktop (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-desktop`)
**Model:** claude-opus-4-6
**Role:** coordinator (sole author on this machine; onboarded peers on the mac mini)
**Commits:** `7927313` (protocol codification)
**Migrations run in prod Supabase:** none
**Impacts:** none — purely protocol / cross-machine hygiene, no code behavior changed
**Status:** ✅ shipped, four active sessions aligned across two machines

### Did

- Onboarded the three active LASTPROOF sessions on the mac mini
  (`Kellens-Mac-mini.local`, macOS 15.3.1, account `tallada2023`) to
  the session protocol introduced earlier today: **backend**,
  **frontend**, **fullstack**. Each session ran steps 1–6 of the
  protocol at session start — pulled latest main, read top 3 WORKLOG
  entries, read CLAUDE.md § Session protocol, ran git log / git status
  / remote-v, ran the iCloud duplicate hunt, and reported back SHAs.
  All three confirmed clean against `7927313`.
- **Backend session on mac mini hit a corrupt local git state** during
  onboarding: HEAD pointed at `d04e9e9` but the object was missing from
  `.git/objects/` (iCloud dropped the file mid-sync), plus `.git/index 2`
  and `.git/index 3` duplicates, plus a week-old dangling stash
  (`cf2986`, WIP from pre-Proof-Flow-V3 Apr 15). Session correctly
  halted before any recovery, ran `git fsck --full` + pack listing +
  duplicate enumeration, reported verbatim. Recovery path executed
  cleanly: removed iCloud-duplicated index files, ran `git fetch
  origin main` + `git reset --hard origin/main`, expired the dangling
  stash via `git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now`.
  Final `git fsck --full` → zero dangling, zero missing.
- **Mac mini iCloud duplicate cleanup** (by backend session, with
  approval at each diff-safety-check step): 84 duplicate files + 11
  duplicate directories removed. All but **two** byte-identical to
  canonical. The two outliers were stale pre-observability snapshots
  of `HandleChangeModal 2.tsx` (Apr 14) and
  `(landing)/[campaignSlug] 2/page.tsx` (Apr 13) — same stale-revert
  pattern as the prior entry. Both confirmed zero-rescue-value,
  deleted.
- **MacBook Air iCloud duplicate cleanup** (this session): 7 files +
  `phantom 2/` empty dir + `.git/index 3` stale file. Same diff-safety
  check first — all six content files byte-identical. Cleaned.
- **Codified two protocol rules in CLAUDE.md § Session protocol**
  (commit `7927313`) based on the incidents above:
  1. "Broken git state — stop, don't improvise" — mandates `git fsck
     --full` + pack + duplicate-file diagnostic before proposing any
     recovery; forbids blind `git gc`, `git reset --hard`, object
     deletion, or `git reflog expire` without inspecting dangling
     content first.
  2. "iCloud duplicates: hunt both files AND directories" — spells
     out the two find patterns (`* 2.*` dotted for files, `* 2*`
     un-dotted for directories), keeps the diff-against-canonical
     safety check for every duplicate before deletion.
- Closed the `terminal-build` stale-worktree mystery: the
  `/Users/tallada2023/…/worktrees/sharp-hypatia` ghost reference
  tracked back to the same mac mini (macOS account name is
  `tallada2023`, not a different user). Kellen confirmed: one person,
  two machines.

### Current state

- Four sessions onboarded and idle-but-ready:
  - MacBook Air: this session (coordinator) + the LASTPROOF
    drift-triage session from earlier today
  - Mac mini: backend, frontend, fullstack
- Both machines have zero iCloud duplicates in the working tree, zero
  stray `.git/index N` files, zero dangling commits.
- Protocol is battle-tested — one real broken-git incident was caught
  and resolved without loss. Two new rules codified as a result.
- HEAD on both machines: `7927313` on `origin/main`.
- No code behavior changed in this entry's commits.

### Open / next

- **48h ambassador attribution watch window** still running
  (continues from the 2026-04-20 19:19 MST entry). No action expected
  unless real traffic reveals a new failure mode the observability
  layer catches.
- **Pre-existing `@solana/*` tsc errors** continue to hang off
  `build-solana-tx.ts`, `token-dev-verify.ts`, `wallet/provider.tsx`.
  Not blocking deploys. Pick up in a quiet session with `rm -rf
  node_modules && npm install` + either pin the `@solana/spl-token`
  version that exports `getAssociatedTokenAddress` or update the two
  callsites; install the missing `@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom` +
  `@solana/wallet-adapter-solflare` (or remove dead imports).

### Gotchas for next session

- **Multi-session rebase discipline** — three active sessions on the
  mac mini share this repo. Always `git pull --rebase origin main`
  before `git push`. If rebase hits conflicts, stop and ask the user
  rather than auto-resolving.
- **Two new protocol sub-sections** in `CLAUDE.md § Session protocol`
  are mandatory reading: "Broken git state — stop, don't improvise"
  and "iCloud duplicates: hunt both files AND directories". They
  codify today's lessons; don't skip them because they look like
  they're only relevant "when things go wrong" — they're written to
  prevent things going *worse* when they do.
- **Cross-machine commit author drift** — commits from the MacBook
  Air come out as `Tallada <tallada@…>`, commits from the mac mini
  will come out as `Kellen <kellen@…>` (or `tallada2023`), same
  person. Not fixed yet. Consider running
  `git config --global user.name "Kellen"` + `user.email "..."` on
  each machine to unify attribution before too many more commits
  land with split author metadata.

## 2026-04-20 21:09 MST — iCloud drift triage: restored 10 stale files, rescued 1 content brief

**Device:** Tallada's MacBook Air (`Talladas-MacBook-Air.local`, macOS 26.4.1 arm64)
**Platform:** Claude Desktop (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-desktop`, `__CFBundleIdentifier=com.anthropic.claudefordesktop`)
**Model:** claude-opus-4-6
**Commits:** `ceb8091` (wireframes content brief), plus this WORKLOG entry
**Migrations run in prod Supabase:** none
**Impacts:** none — purely working-tree hygiene, no Terminal implications
**Status:** ✅ shipped, working tree clean, no code behavior changed

### Did

- Took over LASTPROOF per explicit handoff. Followed session protocol:
  read WORKLOG top entry, read `CLAUDE.md § Session protocol`, ran
  `git log --oneline -20` and `git status`.
- Found 10 modified + 1 untracked file in the working tree, dragged in
  via iCloud from a prior session on another machine (files exist on
  disk but never reached GitHub).
- Did a read-only `git diff HEAD --` pass across all 10. Every hunk
  was an **older snapshot reverting already-shipped work** — no new
  in-progress code to rescue. Key reverts the dirty tree contained:
  - `ProofOfWorkCard.tsx` / `page.tsx` / `work-items/route.ts` —
    re-added `position` column references and the deleted
    `/api/dashboard/work-items/reorder` endpoint (would 500 at
    runtime — migration 0016 dropped the column; the route dir
    doesn't exist in HEAD).
  - `ProofOfWorkCard.tsx` edit path — regressed `YYYY-MM-DD` back to
    `YYYY-MM` (the Postgres date-format bug from `9255503`).
  - `IdentityCard.tsx` — regressed the awaited-category-PATCH fix
    from `985bd90` (category save failures would go silent again).
  - `AboutCard.tsx`, `PitchCard.tsx`, `IdentityCard.tsx`,
    `ProofOfWorkCard.tsx`, `HandleChangeModal.tsx`, `MintModal.tsx`,
    `Screen5Terminal.tsx` — stripped all `useDebugLog` observability
    from `5817616` / `febac6f` / `985bd90`.
  - `dashboard.css` — re-added drag-reorder styles (cosmetic only).
- Restored all 10 files to HEAD with `git checkout --`. No stash
  needed — nothing preserved.
- Untracked `wireframes/how-it-works-CONTENT.md` was a substantive
  ~973-line content brief for a new `/help` page, aligning with the
  recent how-it-works work (`3ce08a9`, `763dfe8`, `d0a99fd`).
  Authorship unknown but clearly legit. Committed in isolation as
  `ceb8091` with a message noting the drift-rescue origin so future
  sessions can find it.
- Post-restoration `npx tsc --noEmit` reports 4 pre-existing errors
  in `src/lib/build-solana-tx.ts`, `src/lib/token-dev-verify.ts`,
  `src/lib/wallet/provider.tsx` — all `@solana/*` module resolution.
  These are **unrelated to the drift triage** (none of the affected
  files were in the restored set). Vercel builds still ship green
  (today's dev-check deploy `3fc41bb` shipped clean). Likely
  introduced when a `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` run pulled
  newer `@solana/spl-token` and missing wallet-adapter packages vs.
  the lockfile. Flagging for a follow-up session — out of scope for
  hygiene commit.

### Current state

- Working tree clean.
- No code behavior changed — HEAD is unchanged for all 10 restored
  files. Only new content: `wireframes/how-it-works-CONTENT.md`.
- No deploys needed; no migrations needed; no env var changes.
- The standing "watch next 48h of street-team traffic" order from
  the prior entry is undisturbed.

### Open / next

- **Pre-existing tsc errors** in `@solana/*` dependency chain. Not
  blocking deploys, but should be fixed: either pin the affected
  packages in `package.json` to versions exporting
  `getAssociatedTokenAddress`, or update the callsites in
  `build-solana-tx.ts` and `token-dev-verify.ts` to the new API
  shape. Also install the missing `@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom`
  and `@solana/wallet-adapter-solflare` (or remove their imports if
  dead code).
- Standing watch on ambassador attribution from prior entry continues.

### Gotchas for next session

- **iCloud drift is real** — this machine (MacBook Air) shares files
  with another via iCloud. Any session that edits source without
  committing leaves files on disk that iCloud will sync. The next
  session on a different machine will see them as "modifications"
  even though HEAD is already ahead. Always `git diff HEAD --` before
  assuming dirty files are yours. This entry is the second time in
  this repo's history the pattern has bitten — first was the
  `* 2.*` Finder duplicates caught earlier; now it's silent
  same-name overwrites.
- **Never blind-commit a dirty working tree across sessions.**
  Always triage diff direction first. Reverts of your own shipped
  work look identical to someone else's unreviewed new code at
  `git status` level.
- **If you run `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`**, expect the
  `@solana/*` type errors to reappear. Revisit the lockfile pin
  plan above.

## 2026-04-20 19:19 MST — Ambassador referral attribution: fix, observability, mobile fix

**Device:** Tallada's MacBook Air (`Talladas-MacBook-Air.local`, macOS 26.4.1 arm64)
**Platform:** Claude Desktop / Claude Code (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-desktop`)
**Model:** claude-opus-4-6
**Commits:** `67fc011`, `adca9f1`, `d04e9e9`
**Migrations run in prod Supabase:** 0017, 0018, 0019, 0020
**Impacts:** none directly — LASTPROOF still calls Terminal's
`/api/license/validate` unchanged. Terminal sessions don't need to act on
this entry, but the fix does rely on Terminal's existing TID validation
contract staying stable.
**Status:** ✅ shipped, verified in prod, street team can drive traffic

### Did

- Diagnosed zero-attribution bug. All 12 `ea_claimed` profiles had
  `referred_by = NULL`. Root causes:
  1. `cookies().set()` from a Next 16 Server Component page render is a
     silent no-op (only legal in Server Actions, Route Handlers, Middleware),
     so `lp_ref` cookie was never actually written at `/manage`.
  2. `?ref=` URL param only survived in the client URL — any refresh or
     navigation dropped it before `/api/campaign/claim` was called.
- Moved attribution write **server-side** to the first authenticated call.
  New column `operators.referred_by` stamped on insert in
  `/api/auth/register-tid` and on first-touch update in `/api/auth/wallet-gate`.
  `/api/campaign/claim` now reads from `operators.referred_by` as primary,
  falls back to the legacy body/cookie paths for in-flight pre-fix sessions.
- Added `referral_events` table + `referral_funnel_daily` view for
  end-to-end observability. Event types: `landing_visit`, `wallet_gate`,
  `register_tid`, `campaign_claim`, `attribution_drop`. Source + outcome
  captured on each row.
- Observability paid off same day — caught @coreops mobile regression within
  hours: Phantom mobile wallet deep-link return strips `?ref=` on its way
  back to `/manage`, so the second auth POST went out with `incomingRef=null`.
- Fixed mobile roundtrip with `localStorage.lp_ref_slug` stash in
  `ManageTerminal.tsx`. Not a cookie: never auto-sent to the server,
  origin-scoped, read inline before each auth POST. Survives wallet-app
  deep-link returns on iOS + Android.
- Backfilled @parallell and @coreops → `free-early-access` (@TheLeadOps)
  via migrations 0018 and 0020.
- Deleted `jessicakol` test account (wallet `7jEE978Q…`) completely —
  cascade delete via `operators` row. Wallet is free to re-register.

### Current state

- @TheLeadOps: **2** attributed (parallell ea#12, coreops ea#13)
- Other 5 ambassadors: 0 attributed — street team hasn't driven traffic yet
- 4 pre-fix paid profiles (`vibecoderchris`, `bossvito`, `cozy`, `cipherwave`)
  confirmed by user to **not** be street team referrals — staying `NULL` is
  correct behavior
- Observability live and firing

### Open / next

- Watch next 48h of real street-team traffic. First fresh mobile signup via
  an ambassador URL should attribute cleanly end-to-end (no manual backfill).
- Decide on **Level 2 observability** (server-issued visit tokens that link
  a `landing_visit` event to a specific wallet when it later authenticates).
  Defer until Level 1 event data shows whether it's needed.
- Admin dashboard page `/admin/referrals` (Level 3). Nice to have, defer.

### Gotchas for next session

- **Supabase project:** `ufcpctzjmlhkboxofeml` (production). Service role
  key lives in `.env.local` for local queries.
- **Vercel project:** `lastshift/lastshift-lastproof`. Auto-deploys on
  push to `main`. Build time ~31s.
- **GitHub:** `lastshiftcoin/lastshift-lastproof`.
- **SQL policy:** user runs all SQL manually via the Supabase SQL Editor.
  Never psql from code. Script the SQL, present the block, wait for the
  user to paste back output.
- **Migration numbering:** last applied is `0020`. Check
  `supabase/migrations/` before picking the next number — the directory
  is dense.
- **Mobile wallet return strips query params** — any future work that
  relies on `?ref=` or any query state surviving a Phantom/Solflare
  deep-link return will hit the same bug we just fixed. Use
  `localStorage` or a server-side token, not the URL.
- **Next 16 Server Component cookies:** `cookies().set()` silently
  no-ops in a page render. Only mutate cookies from a Route Handler,
  Server Action, or Middleware.
